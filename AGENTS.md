# TeaAgent Operating Rules

## Architecture

- Keep the harness thin: orchestration, tool governance, state boundaries, audit, and validation belong here; domain reasoning belongs in the model or skills.
- Prefer protocol assets over vendor-specific assets: MCP-style tool metadata, Skills, and portable run records.
- Do not add a second agent framework without an ADR.

## Tool Governance

- Tools must be registered through `ToolRegistry`.
- Each tool requires a name, description, input schema, output schema, and annotations.
- Destructive tools must not run unless an approval token is present for that exact tool call.
- Tool errors must be actionable and classified.

## Runtime Safety

- Every run must have an iteration limit and tool-call limit.
- Every tool call and final result must be recorded in the audit log.
- Long-lived state must be externalized; in-memory runner state is temporary only.

## Skills

- Keep `SKILL.md` short and route details into `REFERENCE.md` or examples.
- Treat skills as reviewed supply-chain assets, not casual prompt snippets.
